# Data Structures and Algorithms COMP2521 2022 Term 2

## Course Summary

The goal of this course is to deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms and how these can be employed effectively in the design of software systems. It is an important course in covering a range of core data structures and algorithms that will be used in context in later courses. You explore these ideas in lectures, tutorials, lab exercises, quizzes and assignments. Assessment involves lab exercises, quizzes, assignments and a final exam involving both practice and theory. At the end of the course, we want you to be a solid programmer, with knowledge of a range of useful data structures and programming techniques, and ready to continue with further specialised studies in computing.

## Topics

This course provides an introduction to the structure, analysis and usage of a range of fundamental data types and the core algorithms that operate on them. Key topics are:

- Recursion
- Analysis of algorithms
- Abstract data types
- Binary search trees
- Balanced search trees
- Graphs
- Sorting algorithms
- Heaps
- Hashing
- Tries

## Assessment

Your final mark in this course will be based on components from the assignment work, quizzes, labs, and the final exam.
