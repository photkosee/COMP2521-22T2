NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of people who  have  been  added  to
  Friendbook.

===============
  FbUnfriend
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(...)

- Explanation: ...

===============
FbMutualFriends
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^2)

- Explanation: First while loop looping through all friends of name1 ~= n and 
inside the loop also looping through all friend of name2 ~= n, so it will be 
O(n * n). 

===============
 FbFriendRecs1
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^4)

- Explanation: There is a loop through all people inside a loop through all 
people which ~= n^2. Deep in it we call function FbMutualFriends which is n^2, 
so the whole function will be (n^2)*(n^2).
