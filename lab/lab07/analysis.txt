NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: Even checking every box in a maze and find a way back is still
O(n) because we don't have any loop inside a loop here. 

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: Working like solveBfs but using stack instead of queue.
