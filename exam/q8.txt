Question 8

(a) Give the max heap (in array representation) that would result from
    inserting the keys in the order given into an initially empty heap.

    NOTE: Replace the underlines with the keys. Index 0 should be unused.

[0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7]  [8]
     H    X    M    A    P    S    Y    E

(b) Give the max heap (in array representation) that would result from
    deleting the largest key from the heap produced in part (a).

[0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7]  [8]
          X    M    A    P    S    Y    E
